## Non-Automated parts of this project

The training pipeline is not perfectly automated. Ideally, you would run just create a config file, run one command, and end up with a totally trained network.

#### Writing boards needs to be done manually for every partition.
Ideally it would do each one separately, and then create appropriately-named files.
